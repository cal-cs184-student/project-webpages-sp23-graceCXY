            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p>
                For our final project, we will work to create a rendering of a black hole, with the end goal to produce visually attractive images that are (moderately) physically accurate, adjusting for our limited computational power and physics knowledge. We will simulate a black hole’s gravitational lensing of its accretion field and a background field of stars.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2> Project Descriptions </h2>
            <div>
                <h4> Context </h4>
                <p> Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne and visual effects studio DNEG (Double Negative) worked together on the 2014 film Interstellar to present audiences with visualizations of a black hole. The images they rendered were as physically accurate as possible, with the exception of several artistic decisions. </p>
                <p> In particular, a past CS 184 Project, <a href = "https://celticspwn.github.io/CS184FinalProject/final.html">Black Hole Raymarcher by Kenny Chen, Leonardo Tang, and Lawrence Zhao,</a> 
                    similarly attempts to build a shader method to render black holes, but focuses primarily on speed/efficiency (and thus approximations) to create real-time rendering. We hope to build a more realistic renderer with additional and more accurate effects, with the potential for animation (although likely not in real-time due to computational intensity).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4> Problem </h4>
                <p> 
                    In most applications (such as in the Ray Tracer written in Project 3 as well as most graphics applications), we assume that light travels in a perfectly straight line without loss in energy. While this is a safe assumption in most scenarios, this is not always the case. Einstein’s theory of general relativity describes gravity as the result of curvature of space-time; when light travels through curved space-time generated by very massive objects (large stars, black holes, etc.), the light’s behavior becomes warped and significantly different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads to many interesting effects:
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Gravitational Lensing</u>: when light gets bent, refocused, or distorted when passing near a large object.</li>
                        <li><u>Gravitational Redshift</u>: when light loses energy when traveling away from a massive object, resulting in a longer wavelength </li>
                        <li><u>Time Dilation</u>: where time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields</li>
                        <li>Black hole specific effects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    light that passes what is known as the event horizon of the black hole becomes trapped and is unable to escape (hence the name)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The rotation of a blackhole can distort the space around it (Lense-Thirring effect) as well as the shape of the event horizon.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Challenges </h4>
                <p>
                    First, we will need to implement some version of gravitational lensing, which has significantly different physics from the ray tracing that we implemented in project 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we will need to find ways to model multiple components of a black hole simulation, including the black hole itself, the accretion disk, and the surrounding star field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may wish to account for gravitational redshift/Doppler effect, which would alter the colors of visible light reaching the camera.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Intended Solution</h4>
                <p>There are resources from which we can learn the appropriate equations to approximate and model gravitational lensing. We can begin with a simpler model of a non-spinning black hole, and then move forwards with a spinning black hole.</p>
                <p>Motion blur can be simulated with Monte Carlo estimation, integrating over time in addition to space.</p>
                <p>One way of rendering a star-field is to create an environment map recording star positions as points in the source plane. This environment map can then be sampled.</p>
                <p>A black hole only has two independent properties: its mass and the rate at which it spins. After choosing appropriate values for these parameters, we will be able to calculate (or approximate) any other necessary properties, such as its circumference and gravitational pull.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
            <div>
                <h4>What type of images we will create:</h4>
                <p>Simulation of gravitational lensing around a large black hole, both non-spinning and spinning. We should see the entirely black shadow of the black hole, as well as concentric circles of warped starlight originating from behind the black hole (in the background relative to the camera position).</p>
                <p>Rendering of black hole with accretion disk; both for non-spinning and spinning black holes.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Interactivity:</h4>
                <p>Given the computational intensity of renders, our system likely will not be interactive.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy).
                </h4>
                <p>
                    While it is difficult to set clear metrics, existing black hole renders such as ___ or pictures like the Einstein Cross provide a good target for expected behavior. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Each effect we implement should have a (hopefully) noticeable effect on the renders. We can compare these with the behavior we expect, and tune parameters to produce different results. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>(1) What we plan to deliver</h4>
                <p>Several high quality renders of different configurations, in which we show different and additive effects of each gravitational effect we implement.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4> (2) what we hope to deliver. </h4>
                <p>
                    If time permits, there are a variety of directions we can take with this project.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <u>Exploring Time Dilation</u>: one effect of gravity is that light can take different amounts of time to travel along different paths, allowing a certain event to appear multiple times (such as with the SN Refsdal supernovae). With enough time and computational power, we could simulate a changing background texture to model these effects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Multiple objects</u>: Most renders typically focus on only one large object; we could potentially simulate the effects of multiple of these objects all interacting with light and each other.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Active star deformation and accumulation in the accretion disk: sometimes, when a star gets too close to a black hole, it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces. The star's matter is gradually added to the accretion disk of the black hole, but forms long streams of gas that could be pretty visualizations.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bagels, bunnies, etc
                        </li>
