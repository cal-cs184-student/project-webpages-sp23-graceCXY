<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project we implemented a few techniques to model geometric shapes. 
  Starting with De Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves, and moving to using the half-edge data structure for shading and subdivision, we were able to model and visualize many different shapes just by modeling triangles.
  We also learned about normal vectors and their importance in shading, along with remeshing through edge flip and edge splitting.
  Some of the most interesting things we learned from this project are the power of subdivision and how it can transform one simple shape into a very different shape, as well as the unique curves we can generate just by using de Casteljau Subdivision on a few points.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm recursive perform linear interpolation for every segment of a line between control points. 
  At each step, given x control points, the algorithm will generate x-1 intermediate points. 
  The process will repeat until the program reaches 1. 
  
  We implemented the evaluateStep function for Bezier Curves which would be called at each step. 
  By looping through the vector of points, we take every combination of adjacent points and find the linear interpolated intermediate given t. 
  We output this new vector of intermediate points.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces in that we generate curves in one direction and use final points from these curves to generate a point in the other direction. 

  We implemented this part by modifying functions evaluateStep(), evaluate1D(), and evaluate().
  EvaluateStep is almost identical to the implementation to part 1. 
  In Evaluate1D(), we repeated the linear interpolation process for each level until we arrived at the 1 final point for a set of points.
  In evaluate(), we use the evaluate1D() function from earlier to generate points for all rows and using the set of final points for each row, we generated the final point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by looping through all triangles around a vertex through traversing the halfedge data structure. 
    For each of the triangles, we found the normal of each face and computed the area of the triangle to calculate the weighted normal. 
    To compute the triangle, we first cross product p3-p1 and p2-p1 to find the normal vector, we then took the square root of the sum of x, y, and z squared of that normal vector. 
    We then normalized the weighted normals of all triangles.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented edge flip by first drawing out the expected before and after diagram, labeling each halfedge, edge, vertex, and face in both diagrams.
    Then, we defined the labeled halfedges, edges, vertices, and faces in relation to the provided edge e0 according to the before diagram. 
    Then, we updated the pointers of all halfedges, edges, vertices, and faces to point at the appropriate values according to the after flip diagram.  

    A implementation trick we used was to label the next(), twin(), vertex(), edge(), and face() of every halfedge all together. 
    Even though some of the pointer values shouldn't change, simply writing the values out and ensuring its correctness saved us a lot of debugging time.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Similar to part 4, we drew out diagrams for before and after spliting with labeled halfedges, edges, vertices, and faces. 
    
    We created 6 new halfedges, 1 new vertex, and 3 new edges. 
    Then, we updated the pointers accordingly. 

    We also used the same implementation trick as above by making more pointer assignments than needed to ensure correctness.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    We first tried to implement this section without the implementation trick from the previous part. 
    Then, we ran into a bug and to help with debugging, we tried to be thorough with pointer assignments. 
    Going through our diagram and code again, we found that 2 pointers were wrongly assigned. 
    It was indeed a long but rewarding debugging journey.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  To implement loop subdivision, we followed the comments provided in the starter code.
  First, we computed positions for all the original vertices using the formula newPosition = 1 - (nu) * position + u * original neighbor position sum, where n = the degree of the vertex, u = 3/(8n) except when n = 3, where u = 3/16, and original neighbor position sum is the sum of positions of all the vertices that are neighbors of the current one.
  We also set the flag in the Vertex object isNew to false, to be used later.

  Next, we computed updated vertex positions associated with each edge using the formula position = (3/8) (A+B) + (1/8) (C+D) where A and B are the vertices on each end of the original edge, and C and D are the opposite vertices of the two triangles that the edge is a part of.
  These positions will be used later as the position of the new vertex created when we split every edge.

  Third, we iterated through every edge (noting to only iterate through the original edges, not splitting any of the newly created edges from the split), and split each of them using the edge split algorithm from the previous part. The edge split algorithm creates a new vertex, whose position we set to the edge position computed in step 2. It also creates new edges, and we iterated through these new edges to find ones that connected an old vertex to a new vertex - if this was the case, we flipped that edge.

  Finally, we moved the positions of the vertices to the positiosn we computed in the first step.

  These steps allowed us to take each triangle and subdivide it into 4: 4-1 subdivision. 

  One interesting implementation trick we used was in finding the A, B, C, D vertices described in step 2. We used the halfedge data structure to find the two vertices on each side of an edge, and traversed through the triangles to find the other two vertices.
  One debugging trick that ended up helping us find our bugs was to run the code one step at a time. For example after splitting edges, we would run the code to ensure that our splitting was performed correctly before doing the flipping or moving vertex positions.
  Another debugging trik we used was to step through the code and ensure our numbers weren't being casted to integers, which was an issue we encountered in the previous project.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  After loop subdivision, the mesh generally gets smoother. Sharp corners and edges, such as in the cube, get immediately smoothed out and are very noticeable, while in others such as in the bean shape with no sharp corners and edges, the shape generally gets smoother but is less noticeable. 
  By presplitting some edges, we were able to retain some of those corners as seen in the teapot below.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  The cube definitely becomes asymmetric after repeated subdivisions, most notable after about 3 subdivisions. Even after just 1 subdivision, the cube loses its cube-like shape. We preprocessed the cube by splitting the diagonal edge on each of the 6 faces first, so that it becomes symmetric. Originally, the edge was split facing an arbitrary direction, causing asymmetry. This splitting helps alleviate the effects because the cube now has 4 symmetric triangles on each of its faces, so loop subdivision on these 4 triangles will retain the symmetry.
